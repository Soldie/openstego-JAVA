OpenStego v0.1.1
----------------

OpenStego is a command line tool developed in Java for image based stegano-
graphy. It currently supports embedding of data files into 24 bpp images only.
Image containing embedded data is written out in PNG format.

USAGE:
     java -jar <path>/openstego.jar -embed [options] <data_file> <image_file>
  OR java -jar <path>/openstego.jar -extract <image_file>

  For '-embed' option, openstego will embed the data into the given image file
  and save the file as PNG after appending '_out' to the file name.

    [options] can be specified for '-embed' and should be of the format 
    '--name=value' pairs. Supported options are:

      maxBitsUsedPerChannel  - Max number of bits to use per color channel in
                               the image for embedding data. This value can be
                               increased at the expense of image quality, in
                               case size of image is not able to accommodate
                               the data (Default = 3)

      useCompression         - Flag to indicate whether compression should be
                               used on the data or not (Default = true)

  For '-extract' option, openstego will output the extracted data on the
  standard OUT stream, so make sure that output is redirected to required file.

TODO:
  - Create GUI for the tool
  - Implementation of OpenStego in C++
