OpenStego v0.3.0
----------------

OpenStego is a tool developed in Java for image based steganography. It
also supports optional encryption of data before embedding in the image.
Currently, only 24 bpp images are supported. Image containing embedded
data is written out in PNG format.

USAGE:

To start the GUI:

   java -jar <path>\openstego.jar
OR Use the script file provided (openstego.bat / openstego.sh)

For command line interface:

   java -jar <path>\openstego.jar -embed [options] <data_file> <img_file>
OR java -jar <path>\openstego.jar -extract [options] <img_file> <output_folder>

  For '-embed' command, OpenStego will embed the data into the given <img_file>
  and save the file as PNG after appending '_out' to the file name.

  For '-extract' option, OpenStego will output the extracted data from
  <img_file> to the given <output_folder>.

    [options] can be specified as '--name=value' pairs. Supported options are:

      maxBitsUsedPerChannel  - Max number of bits to use per color channel in
                               the image for embedding data. This value can be
                               increased at the expense of image quality, in
                               case size of image is not able to accommodate
                               the data (Default = 3)
                               (Only applicable for '-embed' command)

      useCompression         - Flag to indicate whether compression should be
                               used on the data or not (Default = true)
                               (Only applicable for '-embed' command)

      useEncryption          - Flag to indicate whether encryption should be
                               used on the data or not (Default = false)
                               (Only applicable for '-embed' command)

      password               - Password to be used for encryption or
                               decryption (Default = null)
