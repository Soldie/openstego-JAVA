OpenStego v0.3.1
----------------

OpenStego is a tool developed in Java for image based steganography. It
also supports optional encryption of data before embedding in the image.
Currently, only 24 bpp images are supported.

USAGE:

For GUI:
  java -jar <path>\openstego.jar

For command line interface:
  java -jar <path>\openstego.jar [command] [options] ...

Valid commands are:
-embed                  Embed data into image
-extract                Extract data from image
-supportedReadFormats   List down the supported formats for cover file
-supportedWriteFormats  List down the supported formats for stego file

Embed Data:
  java -jar <path>\openstego.jar -embed [options] <msg_file> <cover_file> <stego_file>

  where,
    <msg_file>   - Source message/data file
    <cover_file> - Cover file (image in which message will be embedded)
                   If '-random' is provided as the value here, then a random
                   image having noise is generated and used as cover file.
                   The size of the image is the minimum required to embed
                   the given source file when 'maxButsUsedPerChannel'
                   bits are used per color channel
    <stego_file> - Output stego file containing the embedded message

Extract Data:
  java -jar <path>\openstego.jar -extract [options] <stego_file> <output_dir>

  where,
    <stego_file> - Stego file containing the embedded message
    <output_dir> - Output folder where message file will be written

[options] can be specified as '--name=value' pairs. Supported options are:

  maxBitsUsedPerChannel  - Max number of bits to use per color channel in
                           the image for embedding data. This value can be
                           increased at the expense of image quality, in
                           case size of image is not able to accommodate
                           the data (Default = 3)
                           (Only applicable for '-embed' command)

  useCompression         - Flag to indicate whether compression should be
                           used on the data or not (Default = true)
                           (Only applicable for '-embed' command)

  useEncryption          - Flag to indicate whether encryption should be
                           used on the data or not (Default = false)
                           (Only applicable for '-embed' command)

  password               - Password to be used for encryption or
                           decryption (Default = null)


Java Advanced Imaging API can be installed to get support for more image
formats (like BMP, etc). It can be downloaded from:  https://jai.dev.java.net
